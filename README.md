# BroadcastReceiver_examples

Android *only* examples of using `android.broadcast.BroadcastReceiver`.

There are two examples, WiFi_scanner_example, and Bluetooth_scanner_example.

To find a file containing a list of all the Android *system* Broadcast actions for a particular installed `android.api`: on a machine where Buildozer has been run, type `find ~/.buildozer -name broadcast_actions.txt`
